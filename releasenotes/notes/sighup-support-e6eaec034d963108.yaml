    Issuing a SIGHUP to the ironic-inspector service will cause the service to
    reload and use any changed values for *mutable* configuration options.

    Mutable configuration options are indicated as such in the `sample
    configuration file <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-inspector/latest/configuration/sample-config.html>`_
    by ``Note: This option can be changed without restarting``.

    A warning is logged for any changes to immutable configuration options.
