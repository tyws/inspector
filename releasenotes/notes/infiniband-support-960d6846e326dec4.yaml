    InfiniBand interface discovery is now supported through introspection.  The
    ironic-inspector will add the client-id to the corresponding ironic port
    that represents the InfiniBand interface. The ironic-inspector should be
    configured with a list of interfaces ``firewall.ethoib_interfaces`` to
    indicate which Ethernet Over InfiniBand Interfaces are used for DHCP.
