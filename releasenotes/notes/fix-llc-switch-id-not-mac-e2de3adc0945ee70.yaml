    Fixes bug in which the ``switch_id`` field in a port's ``local_link_connection`` can be set to
    a non-MAC address if the processed LLDP has a value other than a
    MAC address for ``ChassisID``. The bare metal API requires the ``switch_id``
    field to be a MAC address, and will return an error otherwise.
    See `bug 1748022 <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/+bug/1748022>`_
    for details.
