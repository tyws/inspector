features:
  - |
    The PXE filter drivers mechanism is now enabled. The firewall-based
    filtering was re-implemented as the ``iptables`` PXE filter driver.
deprecations:
  - |
    The firewall-specific configuration options were moved from the
    ``firewall`` to the ``iptables`` group. All options in the ``iptables``
    group are now deprecated.
  - |
    The generic firewall options ``firewall_update_period`` and
    ``manage_firewall`` were moved under the ``pxe_filter`` group as
    ``sync_period`` and ``driver=iptables/noop`` respectively.
fixes:
  - |
    Should the ``iptables`` PXE filter encounter an unexpected exception in the
    periodic ``sync`` call, the exception will be logged and the filter driver
    will be reset in order to make subsequent ``sync`` calls fail (and
    propagate the failure, exiting the **ironic-inspector** process eventually).
