upgrade:
  - |
    Old status records are no longer removed by default. They are still
    removed if a node is removed from Ironic.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``node_status_keep_time`` configuration option is deprecated.
    Now that we can remove status information about nodes removed from
    **ironic**, this option does not make much sense,
    and `may be confusing <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-inspector/+bug/1695858>`_
