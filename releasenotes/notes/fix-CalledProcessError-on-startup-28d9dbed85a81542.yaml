    Exception CalledProcessError is raised when running `iptables` cmd on start up.
    The issue is caused by eventlet bug, see:
    https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues/357
    The issue affects *ironic-inspector* only if it manages firewall - configured
    with ``manage_firewall = True`` configuration option.
