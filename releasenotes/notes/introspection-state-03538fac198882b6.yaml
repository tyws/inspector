features:
  - Node introspection state is now kept in a dedicated database column. The
    introspection is now using a finite state machine. The state isn't exposed
    to the user yet.
issues:
  - Due to the nature of the NodeInfo.state attribute (being updated
    independently from the rest of the node_info attributes) if a (DB)
    connection was lost before the Node.state column was updated,
    Node.finished_at and Node.error columns may not be in sync with the
    Node.state column.
upgrade:
  - Node.state and Node.version_id database columns are introduced.
  - The introspection state column defaults to the state ``finished`` unless
    the introspection error column value on a node row isn't null, then node
    state is set to ``error``.
