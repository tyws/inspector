    Wrong provision state name 'inspectfail' in *ironic-inspector* valid
    states for node inspection.
    This issue leads to state inconsistency between *ironic* and
    *ironic-inspector*. For example, if *ironic* inspection timeout is
    lower than *ironic-inspector*'s, and inspection timeout occurs, *ironic*
    will transition node into 'inspect failed' provision state. In such case
    when node inspection finishes without errors the node will be in
    'inspect failed' provision state with inspection in 'finished' state.
