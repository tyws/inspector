    The older ``ipmi_address`` field in the introspection data no longer has
    priority over the newer ``bmc_address`` inventory field during lookup.
    This fixes lookup based on MAC addresses, when the BMC address is reported
    as ``0.0.0.0`` for any reason (see `bug 1714944
    <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ironic-python-agent/+bug/1714944>`_).
