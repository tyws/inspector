fixes:
  - |
    The periodic PXE filter update task now retries fetching port list from
    the Bare Metal service 5 times (with 1 second delay) before giving up.
    This ensures that a temporary networking glitch will not result in
    the ironic-inspector service stopping.
upgrade:
  - |
    Adds dependency on the `retrying <https://github.com/rholder/retrying>`_
    python library.
