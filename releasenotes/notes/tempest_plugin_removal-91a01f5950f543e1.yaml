    The tempest plugin code that was in
    ``ironic_inspector/test/inspector_tempest_plugin/`` has been removed.
    Tempest plugin code has been migrated to the project
    `openstack/ironic-tempest-plugin
    <https://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/ironic-tempest-plugin>`_. This was
    an OpenStack wide `goal for the Queens cycle
    <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/goals/queens/split-tempest-plugins.html>`_.
