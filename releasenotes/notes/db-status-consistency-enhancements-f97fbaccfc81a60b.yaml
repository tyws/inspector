upgrade:
  - |
    A new state ``aborting`` was introduced to distinguish between the node
    introspection abort precondition (being able to perform the state
    transition from the ``waiting`` state) from the activities necessary to
    abort an ongoing node introspection (power-off, set finished timestamp
    etc.)
fixes:
  - |
    The ``node_info.finished(<transition>, error=<error>)`` now updates node
    state together with other status attributes in a single DB transaction.
