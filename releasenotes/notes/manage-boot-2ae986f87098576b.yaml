    Adds new parameter ``manage_boot`` to the introspection API to allow
    disabling boot management (setting the boot device and rebooting)
    for a specific node. If it is set to ``False``, the boot is supposed
    to be managed by a 3rd party.

    If the new option ``can_manage_boot`` is set to ``False`` (the default is
    ``True), then ``manage_boot`` must be explicitly set to ``False``.
