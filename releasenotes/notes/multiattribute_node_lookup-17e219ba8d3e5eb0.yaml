features:
  - |
    Looking up nodes during introspection or discovery now supports multiple
    attributes matching. For example, two nodes can use the same ``bmc_address``
    and still can be distinguished by MAC addresses.
upgrade:
  - |
    Uniqueness of a node ``bmc_address`` isn't enforced any more.
  - |
    The primary key of the ``attributes`` table is relaxed from the
    ``attributes.name, attributes.value`` column pair to a new column
    ``attributes.uuid``.
fixes:
  - |
    Introspection fails on nodes with the same IPMI address but different IPMI
    ports.
