    Adds wildcard ignore entry to ``dnsmasq`` PXE filter. When node
    introspection is active, or if ``node_not_found_hook`` is set in the
    configuration the ignore is removed from the wildcard entry. This ensures
    that unknown nodes do not accidentally boot into the introspection image
    when no node introspection is active.

    This brings ``dnsmasq`` PXE filter driver feature parity with the
    ``iptables`` PXE filter driver, which uses a firewall rule to block any
    DHCP request on the interface where Ironic Inspector's DHCP server is
    listening.
