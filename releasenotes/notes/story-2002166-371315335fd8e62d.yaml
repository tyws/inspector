    Updates the default Ironic API version to 1.38.

    This version is used by default within the Bare Metal Inspection service
    when communicating with the Bare Metal API. It is the default used by
    processing plugins, which may override the version, and by introspection
    rules, which may not override the version.

    1.38 was the API version at the time of the most recent Queens series
    Bare Metal service release (10.1.0).
