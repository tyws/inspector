    A new rootwrap filter is now included to allow control of the systemd
    dnsmasq service used by ironic-inspector. This fixes a permission issue
    when systemctl commands are used as ``dnsmasq_start_command`` and
    ``dnsmasq_stop_command`` in the configuration for the dnsmasq pxe filter.
    See bug `2002818 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2002818>`_.

    .. Note:: The filter uses the systemd service name used by the RDO
              distrubution (``openstack-ironic-inspector-dnsmasq.service``).
