upgrade:

    Experimental setting IPMI credentials support was removed from all versions
    of the API. The current **ironic-inspector** API version was bumped to
    `1.12` to mark this change.
  - |
    The default API version was synchronized with the current API version again
    after removal of the IPMI credentials setting.
