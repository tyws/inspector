class RaidDeviceDetection(base.ProcessingHook):
    """Processing hook for learning the root device after RAID creation.

    The plugin can figure out the root device in 2 runs. First, it saves the
    discovered block device serials in node.extra. The second run will check
    the difference between the recently discovered block devices and the
    previously saved ones. After saving the root device in node.properties, it
    will delete the temporarily saved block device serials in node.extra.

    This way, it helps to figure out the root device hint in cases when
    otherwise Ironic doesn't have enough information to do so. Such a usecase
    is DRAC RAID configuration where the BMC doesn't provide any useful
    information about the created RAID disks. Using this plugin immediately
    before and after creating the root RAID device will solve the issue of root
    device hints.

    In cases where there's no RAID volume on the node, the standard plugin will
    fail due to the missing local_gb value. This plugin fakes the missing
    value, until it's corrected during later runs. Note, that for this to work
    the plugin needs to take precedence over the standard plugin.
